# AGENTS.md

## Local overrides

If `AGENTS.local.md` exists at the repo root, read it and let its instructions take precedence over
this file. It is gitignored for personal, machine-specific preferences and never committed.

## Commands

`Taskfile.yml` wraps the common workflows — run `task --list` to see them. These are the only
entrypoints; never bypass them by calling tools or `python` directly — the task and prek layers
manage the virtualenv, file selection, and flags.

- `task install` — sync the project and dev dependencies from the lockfile (`uv sync --locked`),
  then install the prek hooks.
- `task test` — `uv run pytest` (append args after `--`, e.g. `task test -- -k name`; passing args
  disables coverage, since a subset run would fail the global coverage threshold).
- `task test:matrix` — run the suite on every supported Python version.
- `task check` — `uv run prek run -a` (all hooks). Run before committing.
- To run a single hook: `uv run prek run <hook-id>` (e.g. `uv run prek run max-lines`). Hook IDs
  are in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- `task check:fix` — auto-fix everything that supports it: `uv run ruff check --fix`,
  `uv run ruff format`, `dprint fmt`, markdownlint (`uv run prek run -a markdownlint-cli2`).
- `task clean` — remove build artifacts, caches, and virtualenvs.

## Git hygiene

- Never run `git commit --no-verify`, `git commit -n`, or anything else that skips the prek hooks —
  the hooks are the gate, not an obstacle.
- Fix a failing check at its source. Never edit a test to make it pass; never widen a lint ignore to
  silence a real finding.

## Linter and type-checker configuration

Treat lint and type-check config as fixed. Never add to an ignore list, disable a rule, lower a
severity, or exclude a file to get a check passing — fix the code instead. A suppression is
warranted only when the finding is a genuine false positive or the rule cannot apply (e.g. a
generated file, a documented upstream bug); then suppress at the narrowest scope — an inline
directive with a reason — not in the shared config. When the same inline directive keeps recurring
for the same rule, that is a signal the rule may deserve a config-level ignore — propose it to the
user and wait for explicit approval; never promote a suppression into config on your own.

## Spelling (cspell)

Treat a cspell failure as a prompt to reword, not to grow the dictionary. Prefer plain words in
prose and identifiers. A word earns a `cspell.json` entry only when it comes from outside the
project and cannot be renamed — command names, API identifiers, file formats, proper nouns, domain
vocabulary (e.g. `addopts`, `conftest`, `pyrefly`). In tests, never invent gibberish that needs a
suppression — any real word works for an unknown command, a bogus flag, or filler data, so pick one
(`banana`, not an invented pseudo-word). `# cspell:disable-line` is reserved for fixtures where the
gibberish
itself is the behavior under test, never a dictionary entry.
